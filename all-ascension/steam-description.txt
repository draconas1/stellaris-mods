[h1]All Ascension Paths for 3.8[/h1]

[h1]Do you want your psionic, cybernetic, erudite pops working hand in hand with synths?[/h1]

I'm guessing so because you're looking at this mod.

Regular empires can take all 4 Ascensions, when you Synthetically Ascend you get to pick a portion of your population to remain as organic, because if you've taken the others, they are a bit good by this point.

Hive minds can take both genetics and cybernetics, Driven Assimilators can take synthetic age, cybernetics and engineered evolution.

Assimilation will correctly give organics psionic, cybernetic or both, or turn pops into synths if you have synthetic evolution.  The game works on a pirority system, so once you have synth ascension, all future assimilation will be into synths.

You can take the ascension paths in any order, but because of how internal game logic works around dominant species I recommend [b](psionics and genetics)* -> cybernetics -> synthetics[/b].  *(Psionics and genetics can be in either order)

Because there are [i]lots[/i] of edge cases around this, you are provided with 3 edicts that will fix your primary species to have psionics and cybernetics if they have lost them, and ensure that biological leaders will get psionics, cybernetics and erudite.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
This mod makes a lot of changes to vanilla, it will have mod conflicts with any other mod that alters those giving quite unpredictable behaviour.  


[b]Known Compatibility Issues[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]Planetary Diversity[/b]: Changes the Traditions and AP's around it's special origins.  In theory load mine last / patch with Irony and take mine and you should be fine
[*] Pretty much any mod that has [b]"Traditions"[/b] in its name, since most of them make changes to the ascension traditions.
[/list]
It is compatible with UI Overhaul Dynamic and its sub-mods that increase the number of traditions you can buy.

[b]Troubleshooting[/b]
1. Mod incompatibility, if another mod overrides the same stuff, we will almost certainly conflict badly. You will need to make a merge-patch with Irony.  
2. In order to troubleshoot I need to know what order you did your ascensions in.  They all work differently and order really matters.
3. Taking multiple ascensions gives you a 100% discount on modify species. It also sometimes bugs out the modify species special project, if you can't click the button to implement it, let it fail then try again.
