[h1]Leader Academy and Paragon Summoner[/h1]
Because I got bored milling the leader pool, but wanted something a bit lore friendly.

The Leader Academy is a building for your capital that lets you:
[list]
[*] Recruit a leader at any skill level
[*] Choose exactly their level up traits from all valid basic and veteran traits
[*] Pick their destiny trait from all valid destiny's
[*] Recruit any of the Renowned Paragons from Galactic Paragons
[*] Trigger the events to recruit any of the 4 Legendary Paragons from Galactic Paragons
[*] Send your leaders into rehab to remove negative traits.
[*] Establish first contact with any enclave
[/list]


[h1]How-To[/h1]

[b]To access the leader academy you need to research it from society tech, it appears after Planetary Unification.  This will let you build the Academy building on your capital, which enables a planetary decision to recruit a new leader.[/b]

Hiring leaders at level 4+ (aka veterans) requires either that you have enacted the Capacity Boosters leader-enhancement policy or have the Polytechnic Education tradition from the Discovery tradition category.

Hiring leaders at levels 8, 9 and 10 (aka that have Destiny) requires the Transcendent Learning Ascension Perk, as well as 1 of Capacity Boosters or Polytechnic Education.

Recruiting Renowned Paragons has the same requirements as veteran leaders.  Summoning Legendary Paragons has the same requirements as hiring leaders with a destiny.

The energy cost multiplication for higher leader levels and multiple traits is diliberately ruinous.  If you have any of the policy/AP picks for veteran leaders, all your leaders will also come with the Academy Graduate trait, for bonus XP gain.

If you get free picks from Purity Tradition or Apitutde tradition, you will also get free picks here.

It is primarily designed for Regular empires, but will also work for gestalts, though they have fewer options.

[b]pkbsharks[/b] is a hero player and when I was burned out and couldn't face the 3.10 update and all the leader class changes, went and did it themselves and sent me the patch on git for everyone to enjoy.
