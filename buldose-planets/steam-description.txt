QoL Mod that lets you clear buildings and districts quickly.

[h1]4 New Planetary Decisions[/h1]
All decisions have a 5 day timer simply to let you cancel them in case of miss-click.

[b]Bulldoze All Districts:[/b] Will clear all districts on the planet.

[b]Bulldoze All Buildings:[/b] Will clear all buildings on the planet, leaving just the capital. (Note, if you have a mod-added capital it might get it reset to a standard capital)

[b]Bulldoze and Create Thrall World:[/b] Will remove all buildings and all non-basic districts and turn the world into a thrall world.  Because doing that manually is a PITA. - This means that if you have a planet with a lot of basic districts, it will in effect "keep" those districts when turned into a thall world.
