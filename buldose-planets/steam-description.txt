QoL Mod that lets you clear buildings and districts quickly and lets you downgrade starbases with a click.

[h1]New Planetary Decisions to clear a planet[/h1]
All decisions have a 5 day timer simply to let you cancel them in case of miss-click.

[b]Bulldoze All Districts:[/b] Will clear all districts on the planet.

[b]Bulldoze All Buildings:[/b] Will clear all buildings on the planet, leaving just the capital. (Note, if you have a mod-added capital it might get it reset to a standard capital)

[b]Bulldoze and Create Thrall World:[/b] Will remove all buildings and all non-basic districts and turn the world into a thrall world.  Because doing that manually is a PITA. - This means that if you have a planet with a lot of basic districts, it will in effect "keep" those districts when turned into a thall world.


[h1]Starbase Decisions[/h1]
These decisions run on the star itself, which you must own and can't be occupied.  They run instantly.

[b]Downgrade[/b]: Returns it to an outpost

[b]Remove Buildings[/b]: Clears all buildings

[b]Remove Modules[/b]: Clears all modules

[h1]Edicts[/h1]
For maximum efficiency I have an added an edict menu that lets you downgrade starbases and planets that are not in a sector.  The logic being that after you have conquered a lot of AI tash, it is probably not in a sector.
