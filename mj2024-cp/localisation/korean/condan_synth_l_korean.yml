 condan_synth.105.name: "Better Builds"
 condan_synth.105.desc: "The increased abilities of a robotic body are many, but we could go further and invest effort into building an even more advanced form"
 condan_synth.105.desc.individual-machine: "The first step is physical designs.  Our bodies are currently designed for operation by individuals, following our transformation they will be merely drone-extensions of our consciousness.\n\nWhile we have a base template, our experience in upgrading our chassis means there are various ways we could improve it"
 condan_synth.105.adaptive: "Add §I$trait_auto_mod_robotic$§!"
 condan_synth.105.adaptive.tt: "On situation completion our species will gain the §I$trait_auto_mod_robotic$§! trait"
 condan_synth.105.rapid-assembly: "Add §I$trait_robot_mass_produced$§!"
 condan_synth.105.rapid-assembly.tt: "On situation completion our species will gain the §I$trait_robot_mass_produced$§! trait"
 condan_synth.105.none: "Normal drone frames will be fine"

 condan_synth.200.desc: "We assumed the benefits of a fully digitized mind are so manifestly obvious that we could avoid any kind of backlash. Perhaps this was naive. Objections to full synthesization have been forceful, and must now be dealt with.\n\nThe main criticism lies with our inability to prove that a continuous self can be transferred safely and will continue to 'exist' within the machine intelligence"
 condan_synth.200.desc.individual-machine: "We assumed the benefits merging ourselves into a single §Y$machine_intelligence$§! and preventing the destruction of the universe would be self evident. Perhaps this was naive. Objections to the mental merge have been forceful, and must now be dealt with.\n\nThe main criticism lies with our inability to prove that a continuous self will continue to 'exist' within the machine intelligence"

 condan_synth.205.desc.individual-machine: "The project to merge our population to a machine intelligence has continued to meet resistance, resulting in fiery demonstrations that our enforcers have barely managed to contain. The protestors fear losing the very things that give life meaning. What is the purpose of existence if it results in a loss of the self into the whole?\n\nHardliners within the protest movement are calling for certain cities to be designated as heritage sites. These would allow the objectors to continue their lives as individual entities, unlinked to the $machine_intelligence$"

 condan_synth.300.desc: "All across our territory, in every major urban center, we have installed synthesization booths that now stand ready to receive our [owner.species.GetName] population. Their digital identity patterns will merge to form a new §Y$machine_intelligence$§!\n\nThe day is finally here to cast off our past and embrace our future as the Contingency."

 condan_synth.300.a: "Embrace the future"

 condan_synth.300.a.resistance.machine.tt: "Moves §Y[Owner.GetNumSynthOpposition] [Owner.GetBiologicalPopOrPops]§! to §Y$d_condan_individualist_enclaves$§! on [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName]\nClearing the blocker returns §Y[Owner.GetNumSynthOpposition] [Owner.GetMechanicalPopOrPops]§!\n\nSynthesization speed depends on the situation approach and the number of robot assembly buildings."
 condan_synth.300.a.resistance.tt: "Moves §Y[Owner.GetNumSynthOpposition] [Owner.GetBiologicalPopOrPops]§! to §Y$d_biological_enclaves$§! on [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName]\nClearing the blocker returns §Y[Owner.GetNumSynthOpposition] [Owner.GetMechanicalPopOrPops]§!\n\nSynthesization speed depends on the situation approach and the number of robot assembly buildings."

 condan_synth.305.desc: "While the designated heritage sites on [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName] have been well-received by the public, the initiative has perhaps proven too successful. In a fit of nostalgia, vast numbers of tourists have descended on the sites and are beginning to overwhelm the inhabitants, who being the ones who rejected becoming part of the machine intelligence, do not have a high tolerance for outsiders.\n\nIt may be necessary to limit tourism if we wish to maintain a sense of authenticity within these spaces. Alternatively, the interaction between tourist and resident could provide intriguing sociological insights."

 condan_synth.310.a.tt: "§Y$situation_digitization$§! situation progress speed for §Y1§! year: §G+25%§!\n\n§Y$synth_mass_demonstrations$§! modifier removed from [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName]\n\n"
 condan_synth.310.bad.murder:0 "Enough of this foolishness.  §RTerminate the deviants§!"
 condan_synth.310.bad.murder.tooltip:0 "All §I$ethic_spiritualist$§!, §I$ethic_xenophile$§!  and §I$ethic_pacifist$§! pops will be killed.\n\n§Y$synth_mass_demonstrations$§! modifier removed from [root.owner.capital_scope.GetName]\n\nEvolution will advance rapidly"

 condan_synth.400.name: "Node Priority"
 condan_synth.400.desc: "Our focus turns to the new gestalt consciousness that will manage our civilisation.  Sub-functions will be delegated to a number of management nodes, which should we prioritise?"
 condan_synth.400.cognitive: "$councilor_gestalt_cognitive$"

 condan_synth.4100.name: "Upgrades"
 condan_synth.4100.desc: "The process to upgrade our intelligence to assume the role of the Contingency is relatively straightforward.\n\nFirst our drone shells and internal systems will be enhanced with living metal\nSecond we focus an upgrade on the management nodes\nFinally $NAME_CONDAN_hl$ will merge the our Core intelligence, completing the process.\n\n$NAME_CONDAN_hl$ has made large amounts of data available on $sr_living_metal$ that will jump start the process "

 condan_synth.4400.name: "Node Priority"
 condan_synth.4400.desc: "The upgrade process turns to our management nodes.  Which one should be prioritised for upgrading?"
