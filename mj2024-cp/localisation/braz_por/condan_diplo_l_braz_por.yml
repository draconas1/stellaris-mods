 condan_hub_dig_desc:0 "The planet has suffered extensive orbital bombardment, and the tons of space debris in orbit speaks to a massive fleet action that once took place.\n\nAnalysis of the macro-scale structures of the planet indicates the location of a central facility, a conclusion reinforced by the level of damage that section of the planet has suffered, above and beyond the rest of the world."

 condan_arch.10.name:0 "Defence Grid"
 condan_arch.10.desc:0 "Detailed surveying of the area is showing the top-most region of the planet here was almost certainly defensive in nature.  The planets crust itself has been turned into a composite armour layer sufficiently thick to stop all but the the largest ship mounted weaponry.\n\nBelow the initial armour layers was a honeycomb of tunnels and chambers filled with automated defences, then a second layer of armour and structural protection.  Several systems are stll active, running on internal power cells that still function, and everything active has tried to kill the survey team.\n\nPenetrating this layer would have been nearly impossible were it not for the focused bombardment of this section.  We are able to use the holes blown in the armoured layers to access the lower levels, but it is slow work to find a safe route down.  On a positive side, there is a great deal of high quality material that we have been able to salvage."

 condan_arch.20.name:0 "Communications Hub"
 condan_arch.20.desc:0 "Below the armoured layers we have arrived at the remains of a communications nexus.  Data feeds of all kinds are converging on this location, though most of them have been damaged by the bombardment.\n\nExperiments using the communications lines to send messages indicate they traverse the entire planet, but are heavily damaged.  Some lines remain active, but we have been unable to translate their data feeds\n\nThe progress remains slow and difficult, as the penetrating orbital bombardment has left extensive damage and caused much of the substructure to collapse, but the survey team is convinced that this is indeed the planets central hub, and by following the communications lines we can find whatever is left of the planetary core."
