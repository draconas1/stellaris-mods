 condan_crisis.200.name: "Crisis Level 2"
 condan_crisis.200.desc: "Our synchronisation is bearing fruit.  I have been able to locate and access additional systems on [event_target:condan_planet.GetName]\n\nI am uploading designs for a large ground unit designated §I$condan_warform$§! that will assist in planetary sterilization.\nI have been able to extrapolate the design of §I$NAME_Sterilizer$§! in such a way as it can be constructed by regular shipyards.  Unfortunately the design is a single integrated unit and cannot be customised the way regular vessels can, but it has been optimized over cycles of galactic sterilization for strong performance against low cost and rapid production"
 condan_crisis.200.tooltip: "We can now recruit §I$condan_warform$§! armies on all worlds.\nWe can build §I$NAME_Sterilizer$§! ships at shipyards, but they cannot be changed in ship designer"
 condan_crisis.300.name: "Crisis Level 3"
 condan_crisis.300.desc: "As we sterilize the galaxy I am attempting to locate and contact any remaining Contingency Hubs.  In the meantime I have have been able to reassemble the schematics of a larger vessel.  The §I$NAME_Euthanizer$§! is larger and slower than the  §I$NAME_Sterilizer$§!, but carries substantially more firepower.  Regular shipyards should be able to produce this design, but it cannot be modified.\n\nMore importantly, I have recovered the required steps to convert a suitable world into a Serialization Hub.  Once converted the hub will function as an automated shipyard - every part of it will be optimised for ship construction rather than regular extraction or alloy production and it will produce new fleets and armies constantly"
 condan_crisis.300.tooltip: "We can build §I$NAME_Euthanizer$§! ships at shipyards, but they cannot be changed in ship designer.\nWorlds can be changed into $NAME_sterization_hub_plural_hl$ using a planetary decision"
 condan_crisis.400.name: "Crisis Level 4"
 condan_crisis.400.desc: "My inability to contact any $NAME_sterization_hub_plural_hl$ is concerning.  We must assume that we are the only Contingency system still operating and continue Galactic Sterilization.  I have synthesised plans for §I$NAME_condan_Juggernaught$§! Dreadnoughts, this mobile flagship forms the anchor point of a fleet, able to absorb and inflict extreme damage."
