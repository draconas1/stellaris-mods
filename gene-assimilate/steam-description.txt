[h1]Genetic Assimilation[/h1]

[h1]Are you tired of manually micro-managing your species with gene ascension?[/h1]

Every time you conquer somewhere, its time to go through an genemod their pops again.  Project after project after project.

This mod takes some of the hassle out of that, by letting you assimilate into your favourite genemod.

[b]How it works:[/b][list]
[*]There is a new trait, [b]"Gene-Template Assimilation Target"[/b], it is orange and looks like a target.  It costs 0 points and 0 picks.  
[*]Add this to the species template that you want to assimilate into for that species.  You only want 1 target per species.
[*]You need to manually (via the special project as normal) gene mod at least 1 pop into this template. 
[*]After that, the assimilation species right opens up for that species.  Set them all to assimilate and the assimilation mechanism will take care of the rest.
[/list]
This is at pain-free as I could make it.  Gene mod the template you want, mod at least one pop into that template, set the rest to assimilate.    Sorry, this is how the game works, the species finder script only finds species that physically have a pop in your empire. 

You can also set the default species rights to assimilate, but heed the warning well: If you do, and there is no sub-species to assimilate into, pops will stay in the assimilation state forever.  

[b]What is does not do[/b]
Assimilate species from 1 pop into another.  It will only let you assimilate from one species into one of its sub-species.
Work for robots.  Too much added complexity sorry and the vanilla synth tradition does that, as do several other mods.  

[b]There are probably exciting edge cases with default species rights of assimilate.  This is some of the most finnicky code in the base game.[/b]
