[h1]Planet colour Picker[/h1]

A simple mod that lets you set the colour of your planet name to one of the games pre-defined colours.

Also add a selection of icons to your planet name.  It's a simplified verison of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2031846653]Planet Name Editor[/url] as that mod is now abandoned and has caused CTD's.

Adding multiple icons will likely expand your planet name to more than 32 characters (Icons are names surrounded by special characters, so each is actually 8-10 characters).  This may cause issues with the traditional name editor.
