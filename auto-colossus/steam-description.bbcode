[h1]Do you wish your Colossus acted like an enthusiastic labrador?[/h1]

Using a Colossus in a large war is incredibly tedious.  Unlike armies which have aggressive stance to follow your fleets and invade, or science vessels where you can target key actions from the galaxy view, a Colossus is reluctant and must be manually instructed to crack each and every planet.

If I didn't know better I'd say that PDX are trying to make it hard for you to be evil, perhaps hoping that if it's annoying enough, you'll make nicer choices?

So I replaced your colossus commander with the galaxy's most enthusiastic puppy.

Once you have a Colossus you will get an edict to turn it on, also an option to turn it on when you start a war.

After that it runs a check every year to see if you are at war or experiencing the endgame crisis, and your Colossus is bored (idle).  If so, it finds the nearest planet to crack and sends you a notification telling you where it's going.  If it can't find a planet it sends you a notification to complain.

The system must either have a starbase that you control (regular war) or no starbase (crisis war) and contain a planet controlled by someone you are at war with or an endgame crisis faction.
