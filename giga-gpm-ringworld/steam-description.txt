[h1]GPM Ringworld Modifiers for Birch Worlds and Alderson Discs (3.6)[/h1]
A simple mod that allows the Ringworld planetary modifiers from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guillis Planet Modifiers[/url] to be applied to the Birch World and Alderson Disc of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastrctural Engineering[/url].

Overrides "gpm_is_planet_class_ringworld" scripted trigger to make it count them as ringworlds as this was the lightest touch override.   

Should be after GPM in your load order.
