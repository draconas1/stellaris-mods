[h1]Synthetic Ascension Quality of Life: Keep some Organics (3.7)[/h1]

Watch Aspec and Montu and they will show you the various ways to gimmic Synthetic Ascension to keep a few of your original organic pops around so you can have organic pop growth and pop assembly.  (Have a planet in the process of being colonised is the traditional gimmic, because it gets your colony ships)  

Failing the gimmics you can always import a species from the slave market or conquest.

Or use this mod and skip the gimmicing.  1 day after the synth ascension project completes it will decant 5 pops of your founder species onto your homeworld.

With 5 pops you can spread them round some planets and use them to get some pop growth again with your original species.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Overrides SYNTHETIC_EVOLUTION_PROJECT to call my event first that then delegates to the main ascension event (which I have not touched because it's a massive compatibility nightmare)
