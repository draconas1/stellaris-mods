[h1]Ex-Aeternum Birch World Origin[/h1]
The Decaying Birch World Origin from  [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructural Engineering[/url], but the galatic core systems are prefectly laid out like those of the Aeternum and optimised for Gigastructural play.  

This mod requires both Gigastructures and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=865040033]Guillis Planet Modifiers[/url].  A note that some relics and megastructures are locked behind Ancient Relics and Federations DLC's.

[b]It uses the standard Decaying Birch World origin.[/b]

Did our ancestors conquer most of the glaxy?  Were they the baddies?

[h1]Inner Systems[/h1]
[b]Neutron Star[/b]
A system with a wrecked neutron forge and mega-shipyard.  Clearly was a vast military industrial complex at one point, just waiting to be restored.  Maybe even improved with a Nidavellir Hyperforge on top.

[b]3 Single Star Systems[/b]
2 class A stars and 1 class B star.  Perfect for the Hyperstructural Assembly Yard, Matrioshka Brain, Dyson Sphere or the Nicoll-Dyson Beam

[b]2 Trinary systems[/b]
Numerous precursor digsites, a ruined Interstellar Assembly, Science Nexus and Mega Art Installation, at least 1 class A or B star for all your Steller Lifting needs.
The Art Installation contains a dig site to explore the trophies the precursors kept of their long lost battles.  (Contains all precursor relics).  [i]Note:[/i] the dig site is very difficult!
The Science Nexus contains a dig site to try and scavenge relics that had more active applications.
[i](The sites for both of these are on their respective planets because only planets can have dig sites)[/i]
A while after you get the relevant ascension trait, a new archelogy site will spawn that lets you dig up the info for Leviathian traits. There is a separate one for gene or machine traits, depending on your AP. (Requires relevant DLC)

[h1]Outer Systems[/h1]
All outer systems are black holes with a single planet and some asteriods.  The planet has a precursor bunker complex on it, making them perfect for fortress systems to guard entry.  As for the black hole, a Matter Decompressor, HRAE-MC, or a Penrose ringworld are all possible.

[h1]ZoFE & Nanite Expansion Compatibility[/h1]
If you are running [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2958421797]The Zenith of Fallen Empires[/url] it also adds in Living Metal and Zro fabriciation districts to the Birch World and a Fallen Empire Swarmer Missile tech.
If you are running [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3142620942]Nanite Expansion[/url] it also patches in Nanite fabriciation districts to the Birch World.
It also adds Bunker districts to the Birch world, because I like naval cap.  These require no extra mods.

[h1]Load Order[/h1]
This mod should be [b]BELOW[/b] Gigastructural Engineering in the load order.  It will try to manage itself using the launcher dependencies function, but that is not 100% reliable.  Doesn't matter about GPM.  
The mod overrides the Galactic Core setup, but the rest of the Origin functions the same way, including the situation of exploring the Birch World.

You may also want [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2907738293]this patch[/url] that lets you put GPM ringworld modifiers on the Birch World.
